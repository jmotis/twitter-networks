# NTMRS-code
Python 3.x code to analyze data associated with a book chapter submitted to the New Technologies in Medieval and Renaissance Studies series

The chapter used network creation code from the main repository in addition to this code, which was intended to
* automatically categorize nodes according to the disciplinary conference they most interacted with, as found in a spreadsheet exported from Gephi 
* use Jaccard Indices to compare nodes' membership in Gephi-generated modularity classes with categorizes generated based on conference attendance

While this code is intended to be used with spreadsheets in a particular configuration, with the spreadsheet file names hard-coded, it should be possible to reverse engineer them for more general applications if desired.
